This is an exercise in learning the R graphics package ggplot2 by
visualizing and comparing the batting careers of Sachin Tendulkar and 
Virender Sehwag, two of the most exciting cricket batsmen India has
produced. 

Innings-by-innings data for both batsmen are scraped from the Cricinfo
(http://www.cricinfo.com) Statsguru data query engine.
